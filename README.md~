This software is written and maintained by Baofeng Zhang <BZhang@brooklyn.cuny.edu> and Emilio Gallicchio <egallicchio@brooklyn.cuny.edu> with support from a grant from the National Science Foundation (ACI 1440665).

The plugin interface is based on the [openmmexampleplugin](https://github.com/peastman/openmmexampleplugin) by Peter Eastman.

## Installation

Locate the OpenMM installation directory, otherwise it will default to `/usr/local/openmm`.

Download the package from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/baofzhang/openmm_bedam_plugin.git
```


Build and install the plugin with cmake. Assuming a unix system:

```
mkdir build_openmm_bedam_plugin
cd build_openmm_bedam_plugin
ccmake -i ../openmm_bedam_plugin
```

Hit `c` (configure) until all variables are correctly set, then `g` to generate the makefiles. `OPENMM_DIR` should point to an existing OpenMM installation. `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` normally is the same as `OPENMM_DIR`. The BEDAM plugin requires the python API. You need `python` and `swig` to install it.

Once the configuration is done do:

```
make
make install
make PythonInstall
```

The last two steps may need superuser access depending on the installation target. It is recommended to to build the plugin under a `virtualenv` environment to install the python modules without superuser access.

Important Notes for Installation

Right now, the OpenMM 6.2.0 shows several errors when one installs the BEDAM plugin.

1 After installing OpenMM, when one install BEDAM plugin, it shows the sfmt/sfmt.h is missing. One has to manually copy the sfmt folder to openmm/include/openmm/reference/

2 After installing OpenMM, when one install BEDAM plugin, it shows the lepton/lepton.h is missing. One has to manually copy the lepton folder to openmm/include/openmm/opencl/

3 When one runs 'make PythonInstall', it shows RPMD has errors. One has to manually disable several statements in the file BEDAMPluginWrapper.cpp in the folder build_openmm_bedam_plugin/python/ .

The required disabled statements are as follows
1 

//static void *_p_OpenMM__RPMDIntegratorTo_p_OpenMM__Integrator(void *x, int *SWIGUNUSEDPARM(newmemory)) {
  //return (void *)((OpenMM::Integrator *)  ((OpenMM::RPMDIntegrator *) x));
  //}


2

/*  {&_swigt__p_OpenMM__RPMDIntegrator, _p_OpenMM__RPMDIntegratorTo_p_OpenMM__Integrator, 0, 0},*/

Otherwise, one can not successfully install BEDAM plugin


## Test


```

cd example
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<openmm_dir>/lib
python test.py

Notes:

1 the dmsreader.py in the example/ is the required file, this file can read two dms files into the openmm system.
2 the example is calculating the binding energy for bcd and benzene with lambda equals to 1.0 and with HCT implicit solvent model. The dms files in the example/ have already been added the HCT parameters. 

```

`<openmm_dir>` is the OpenMM installation directory. Again, the last step is best accomplished under the same `virtualenv` environment used to build the python modules.

## async-bedam-test-example

In this example, the GPU-accelerated version of BEDAM absolute binding free energy calculations has been implemented in the OpemMM MD engine and the Asynchronous Replica Exchange job coordination system. The absolute binding free energies of one inhibitor of MCL1 has been computed. Total 18 intermediate steps at lambda=0.0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.1, 0.17, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0, were used to conduct the lambda-biased replica exchanges.

cd async-bedam-example
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<openmm_dir>/lib
python <async_re-openmm_dir>/bedamtempt_async_re.py mcl1-23.cntl

Notes:

1 'async_re-openmm_dir> is the async_re-openmm installation directory.
2 the dmsreaderwscwrestraint.py is a new version of dmsreader.py. In this script, softcore, c-alpha restraint functions are added. In order to apply c-alpha restraint, one has to prepare the receptor dms file in advance so that there are x0, y0 ,z0 values, which are exactly the copies of original x,y,z values.
3 One can control the soft-core value and other parameters in mcl1-23.py.

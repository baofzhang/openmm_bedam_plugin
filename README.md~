# OpenMM BEDAM Plugin

A plugin to add the BEDAM model to OpenMM

## License

This software is released under the LGPL license. See LICENSE.


## Installation

Locate the OpenMM installation directory, otherwise it will default to `/usr/local/openmm`.

Download the package from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/baofzhang/openmm_bedam_plugin.git
```


Build and install the plugin with cmake. Assuming a unix system:

```
mkdir build_openmm_bedam_plugin
cd build_openmm_bedam_plugin
ccmake -i ../openmm_bedam_plugin
```

Hit `c` (configure) until all variables are correctly set, then `g` to generate the makefiles. `OPENMM_DIR` should point to an existing OpenMM installation. `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` normally is the same as `OPENMM_DIR`. The BEDAM plugin requires the python API. You need `python` and `swig` to install it.

Once the configuration is done do:

```
make
make install
make PythonInstall
```

The last two steps may need superuser access depending on the installation target. It is recommended to to build the plugin under a `virtualenv` environment to install the python modules without superuser access.

## Test


```

cd example
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<openmm_dir>/lib
python test.py

Notes:

1 the dmsreader.py in the example/ is the required file, this file can read two dms files into the openmm system.
2 the example is calculating the binding energy for bcd and benzene with lambda equals to 1.0 and with HCT implicit solvent model. The dms files in the example/ have already been added the HCT parameters. 

```

`<openmm_dir>` is the OpenMM installation directory. Again, the last step is best accomplished under the same `virtualenv` environment used to build the python modules.
